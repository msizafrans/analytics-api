The `analytics-api` microservice includes its own application code, configuration files, and dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The dependencies are installed during the containerization process as specified by the Dockerfile. The `buildspec.yml` file outlines the steps for building the Docker image. This process involves logging into AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), building the Docker image according to the Dockerfile instructions, tagging the image, and pushing it to ECR.
