An `analytics-api` microservice that comprises its own application code, configuration files, and necessary dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. The buildspec.yml file defines the steps for building the Docker image. This includes logging into AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), building the Docker image using the instructions in the Dockerfile, tagging the image, and pushing it to the ECR. These dependencies are installed during the containerization process, following the instructions in the Dockerfile.
